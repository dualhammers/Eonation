Come haunt the graveyards // corpse 1 pm1 
and camp the crypts // pm2 
of long dead becomings // pm3
where corvids sit // pm4
on the bones of who you could have been // and wanted to be // See // with hindsight // and lamplight // that your life is sliced // by perception and reception // cause and effect // To wit // the past is the glass // the shape of it // into which you are poured // so taste and see // that you are good // mulled strong spirit
