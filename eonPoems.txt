Come haunt the graveyards // corpse 1 pm1 
and camp the crypts // pm2 
of long dead becomings // pm3
where corvids sit // pm4
...on the bones of who you could have been // pm5
and wanted to be // pm6
See // pm7
with hindsight // pm8
and lamplight //  pm9
that your life is sliced // pm10
by perception and reception // pm11
cause and effect // pm12
To wit // pm13
the past is the glass // pm14
the shape of it // pm15 
into which you are poured // pm16
so taste and see // pm17
that you are good // pm18
mulled strong spirit // pm19
